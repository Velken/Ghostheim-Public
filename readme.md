Note: If you get a warning notification about the installer maybe being unsafe when downloading it, it's because it's a false positive because it is lacking a signing certification and we didn't feel to personally pay $300+/year to sign it for a small community project.

If you get a security warning from windows when running it, same deal as above. Just click "additional info" and "Run Anyway"


Note 2: When installed, it will add a shortcut to your Valheim folder named "Ghostheim", as well as a desktop shortcut. To play on the Ghostheim server, the game has to be launched through any of said shortcuts, otherwise the game will launch in standard mode (vanilla or any other mods you had previously).
